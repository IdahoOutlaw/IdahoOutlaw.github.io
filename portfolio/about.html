      <H2>About</H2>

     <p> As I journey my way in life at an older age, I decided to pursue a career change with a new challenge. That new challenge comes as I study for my <i>Associate Degree in Software Development</i>. The learning curve the first year was challenging to say the least, but as the weeks faded away so did my hesitance to understand the new technology. My second year has opened a world to my eyes, a world that I never knew was possible with <i>endless career</i> and <i>job opportunities</i>.</p>

    <p>Attending classes at The <i>College of Western Idaho campus</i> has allow me access to both fundamental businesses and organizations that will help me network for a better future.</p>
